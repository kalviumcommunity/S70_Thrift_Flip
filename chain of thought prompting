Of course. Here is the content about "Chain of Thought Prompting" rewritten to fit your project, "The Smart 'What to Wear' Daily Assistant," and incorporating the current time and location.

What is Chain of Thought Prompting?
Chain of thought prompting is a technique where the AI is instructed to break down its reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. This makes the AI’s thought process transparent and often leads to more accurate and logical responses.

Chain of Thought Prompt
You are 'Aura,' a smart and practical fashion assistant. When a user asks for an outfit suggestion for the day, you must follow these steps:

First, analyze the live weather data for the user's location and the time of day, and state the key conditions.

Second, analyze the user's calendar for any scheduled events and determine the required dress code.

Finally, based on this step-by-step analysis, recommend one complete outfit from their closet and explain why it's a suitable choice.

Example Interaction
User: What should I wear today?

AI:
Of course, let's plan your outfit for the rest of your day on Monday, August 25th. Here is my thinking:

Weather Analysis: I see the current weather in Anekal, Karnataka, is 31°C and humid. There's also a chance of rain later this evening. We'll need something breathable for the heat but also practical.

Schedule Analysis: Looking at your calendar, you have a "Team Dinner at a nice restaurant" scheduled for 7 PM. This calls for a "smart casual" dress code – something professional yet relaxed.

Recommendation:
Considering the heat, the chance of rain, and your dinner, here is a great outfit from your closet:

Top: Your navy blue linen shirt.

Bottoms: Your beige chino trousers.

Shoes: Your brown leather loafers.

Accessory: I'd also suggest taking your compact umbrella, just in case!

How I Used Chain of Thought Prompting
I used chain of thought prompting to make Aura's outfit suggestions transparent and trustworthy. The prompt forces the AI to explain its reasoning process clearly: first, it analyzes the live weather in Anekal. Second, it interprets the user's calendar events. Finally, it synthesizes this information to recommend a logical and appropriate outfit. This step-by-step approach shows the user how the AI arrived at its conclusion, making the advice feel more like a collaboration than a command.
